# Phasediagram_VGG
This response is an example of using the VGG Deep learning model to draw the phase diagram in condensed matter. The train/test data is a 2-dimensional spectral function (SF) in frequency/wavenumber (energy/momentum space)
where there is a gap between the lower and upper bands, it will be called the gapped phase. On the other hand, where the upper band and lower band touch each other, we call the gapless phase. Tuning parameters such as temperature, coupling constant, order parameter, and chemical potential usually cause the phase transition.
