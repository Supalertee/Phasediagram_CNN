# Phasediagram_VGG
In condensed matter physics, completing the phase diagram of the matter is one of the goals. In physics, not just only physical phases like gas-liquid-solid but also conducting-insulating phases or even topological phases are all important. By tuning controllable parameters, temperature, and coupling constants, sometimes phase transition occurs. In superconductors, by tuning order parameters and chemical potential, the matter changes from an insulating to a superconducting phase. However, in the sense of computational physics, one can simulate the spectral function at the specific parameters, which a common computer might take a while to send out the result.

Now imagine, if we do the full numerical calculation, we don't even know which points phase transition will occur, and of course, it is usually a non-linear relation. So, if one needs to draw the phase transition line (2 tuning parameters) or surface (3 tuning parameters). That might take months to complete the drawing if there is no good algorithm or exact analytic solutions. Here is the point at which I had the idea to apply ML/Deep learning to draw the phase diagrams. If the reader considers carefully, this is nothing other than a classification problem. The idea is that if we can generate 2 completely different phases by numerical calculation, we can have enough different features of gapped and gapless spectral functions.
